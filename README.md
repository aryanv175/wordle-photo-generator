What to do for the basic mvp?

1. identify all the rows and the tiles using a loop
2. check if the row is empy using the dataset
    1. if it is empty end the loop and no need to pint anything.
    2. else: print the appropriate square based on the background color of the current tile.
3. display the x/6

features that should be added afterwards
1. the date and the 'wordle #xxxx' should be displayed
2. a remminder to complete the wordle for that day
3. a button that takes them to wordle website so they can access it conveniently
